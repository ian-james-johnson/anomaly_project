Hello Zach,
I examined the web access log data. The answers to your question are below. I have attached a summary slide with figures to this email. The link to the notebook used to obtain these answers is also given below.

Question 1
Which lesson appears to attract the most traffic consistently across cohorts (per program)?
Highest traffic lesson for each cohort
'PHP Full Srack Web Dev'  : javascript-i 
'Java Full Stack Web Dev' : javascript-i 
'Data Science'            : classification/overview 
'Front End Web Dev'       : introduction.html (I am assuming the others are not lessons but were accessed for technical reasons)


Question 2
Which lessons are least accessed? 
The lists of pages with the least amount of accessions are given in the section work
- Out of 710 pages, 141 of those pages were only accessed once by 'PHP Full Srack Web Dev'
- Out of 1913 pages, 420 of those pages were only accessed once by 'Java Full Stack Web Dev'
- Out of 683 pages, 104 of those pages were only accessed once by 'Data Science'
- For front end web dev, all were low. Content/html-css had two accesses and the other three pages only had one access.
- Many of the least commonly accessed pages covered basics like functions or lists. These topics are reinforced throught the course, and a google search would probably give better answers to specific questions than a broad introduction page. When students encounter a bug, they will probably google the error message instead of returning to the curriculum.


Question 3
What topics are grads continuing to reference after graduation and into their jobs (for each program)?
Alumni are continuing to reference the following topics after graduation:
- 'PHP Full Srack Web Dev' alumni are coming back to javascript-i
- 'Java Full Stack Web Dev' alumni are coming back to javascript-i
- 'Data Science' alumni are coming back to sql/mysql-overview
- 'Front End Web Dev' accessions all seem to be after graduation

Question 4
Are there students who, when active, hardly access the curriculum? If so, what information do you have about these students?
Users who only accessed the curiculum once had an average enrollment period of less than one month.


Question 5
Is there any suspicious activity, such as users/machines/etc accessing the curriculum who shouldnâ€™t be? Does it appear that any web-scraping is happening? Are there any suspicious IP addresses?
- There are two anomalous ip addresses, which is defined as activity more than three standard deviations above the mean.
- The likely explanation for the two anomalous ip addresses is that they belong to shared computers being used by multiple students over multiple cohorts.
- I would recommend determining if these two machines belong to the school.
